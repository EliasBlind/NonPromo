Tired of random files cluttering your desktop? This script is here to help!
It automatically cleans up specified files from your desktop every time your computer starts.

Installation:

Download the repository files.

Run the script ./install.sh.

Choose an installation folder: either accept the default suggestion or enter the full path to any folder.

You‚Äôll be prompted to edit the list of files to delete. If you skip this step, you can always modify the list later in:
[your_installation_folder]/rm_promo/data/promo.txt

At the end, the script will ask if you want to remove temporary files and the installer itself.

Uninstallation:
To remove the program, simply run ./rm_this.sh from the installation folder.

Keep your desktop clean and clutter-free! üñ•Ô∏è‚ú®
